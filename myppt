## PROMPT START

Create a professional PowerPoint presentation for a banking executive audience about our modern data catalog architecture. The presentation should be **2-3 slides maximum**, highly visual, and focused on business value rather than technical implementation details.

### Slide 1: "The Problem & Our Solution"

**Layout:** Split slide with problem on left, solution on right

**Left Side - THE PROBLEM:**
- Title: "Current State: Legacy Data Catalog Risks"
- Use a **warning triangle icon** or **red alert symbol** at the top
- Below, create **3 stacked rounded rectangles** showing pain points:
  1. Rectangle with **broken chain icon**: "Single Point of Failure - HMS outages impact 200+ data engineers"
  2. Rectangle with **no entry icon**: "No Audit Trail - 8-hour incident recovery due to unauthorized table drop"
  3. Rectangle with **old computer icon**: "Legacy Infrastructure - Physical servers, not containerized"
- Use **red/orange color scheme** for problem side

**Right Side - THE SOLUTION:**
- Title: "Modern Catalog: Secure, Scalable, Containerized"
- Use a **green checkmark icon** or **shield icon** at the top
- Create **3 stacked rounded rectangles** showing benefits:
  1. Rectangle with **multiple connected nodes icon**: "Multi-Catalog Architecture - No single point of failure"
  2. Rectangle with **document with checkmarks icon**: "Complete Audit Trail - Compliance-ready tracking"
  3. Rectangle with **container/box icon**: "Cloud-Native - Docker/Kubernetes ready"
- Use **green/blue color scheme** for solution side

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, modern design
- Use icons from Microsoft's icon library or simple geometric shapes
- Plenty of white space
- Professional banking color palette (navy blue, green, gray accents)

---

### Slide 2: "Architecture Overview - How It Works"

**Layout:** Visual architecture diagram with numbered workflow

**Title:** "Unified Catalog Architecture"

**Create a layered architecture diagram using PowerPoint shapes:**

**Top Layer (Governance):**
- Large rounded rectangle spanning the width
- Label: "Audit & Compliance Layer"
- Inside, use 3 small document icons labeled: "Catalog Logs" | "Query Logs" | "Storage Logs"
- Color: Light gray background, dark text

**Middle Layer (Catalog Management):**
- Large rounded rectangle below governance layer
- Label: "Gravitino - Unified Catalog Management"
- Inside, create 3 connected boxes:
  - Left box with **database cylinder icon**: "Polaris (Production Iceberg)"
  - Middle box with **git branch icon**: "Nessie (Migration Staging)"
  - Right box with **filing cabinet icon**: "HMS (Legacy - Being Phased Out)"
- Use **connecting arrows** between these boxes showing data flow
- Color: Navy blue background, white text

**Bottom Layer (Compute & Storage):**
- Split into two sections:
  
  **Left section:**
  - Rounded rectangle labeled "Compute"
  - **Lightning bolt icon** + "Apache Spark"
  - **notebook icon** + "Jupyter"
  - Color: Teal/blue
  
  **Right section:**
  - Rounded rectangle labeled "Storage"
  - **Two bucket icons** side by side:
    - "Tenant A Bucket" (with **store/shop icon**)
    - "Tenant B Bucket" (with **office building icon**)
  - Small text below: "NetApp StorageGRID (S3-Compatible)"
  - Color: Green

**Add numbered workflow arrows (1-4) showing:**
1. Arrow from Compute → Gravitino: "1. Request table metadata"
2. Arrow from Gravitino → Polaris: "2. Route to appropriate catalog"
3. Arrow from Polaris → Storage: "3. Return data location"
4. Arrow from Compute → Storage: "4. Access data directly"

**Visual Style:**
- Use subtle drop shadows on rectangles
- Consistent rounded corners
- Clear, legible fonts (minimum 14pt)
- Color-code different layers

### Slide 3: "Business Value & Tenant Isolation"

**Layout:** Two-column layout with value props and isolation demo

**Left Column - BUSINESS VALUE (40% of slide):**
- Title: "What This Means for the Bank"
- Create **4 benefit cards** (small rounded rectangles stacked vertically):
  
  1. **Shield icon** + "Risk Mitigation"
     - Subtext: "Zero-downtime migration path"
  
  2. **Clock with arrow icon** + "Time Travel"
     - Subtext: "Regulatory point-in-time queries"
  
  3. **Lock icon** + "Tenant Isolation"
     - Subtext: "Retail & Investment units fully segregated"
  
  4. **Cloud icon** + "Modern Infrastructure"
     - Subtext: "Containerized, Kubernetes-ready"

**Right Column - TENANT ISOLATION VISUAL (60% of slide):**
- Title: "Multi-Tenant Security Model"
- Create a **visual diagram showing isolation:**

  **Top section:**
  - Rounded rectangle: "Shared Gravitino Platform"
  - Inside, two separate boxes:
    - Left box with **store icon**: "Retail Banking Namespace"
      - Mini icons: customers table, transactions table, risk models table
    - Right box with **office icon**: "Investment Banking Namespace"
      - Mini icons: portfolios table, trades table, market data table
  - **Red barrier/wall icon** between the two boxes
  - Text: "Access Control Enforced"

  **Bottom section:**
  - Two separate storage buckets:
    - Left: "tenant-a-bucket" (with **store icon**)
    - Right: "tenant-b-bucket" (with **office icon**)
  - **Padlock icons** on each bucket
  - Arrows from namespaces to respective buckets
  - Text below: "Storage-Level Isolation via S3 Bucket Policies"

**Visual Style:**
- Use **green for allowed access**, **red for denied access**
- Clear separation between tenants
- Professional iconography

### Overall Presentation Guidelines:

**Design Principles:**
1. **Minimal text** - Use icons and visuals to tell the story
2. **Consistent color palette:**
   - Primary: Navy Blue (#1B365D)
   - Secondary: Teal/Green (#00A896)
   - Accent: Orange for warnings (#FF6B35)
   - Neutral: Light Gray (#F4F4F4)
3. **Professional typography:**
   - Headers: Calibri Bold or Segoe UI Bold, 28-36pt
   - Body: Calibri or Segoe UI, 16-20pt
   - Labels: 14pt minimum
4. **Icons over clipart** - Use simple, professional icons
5. **White space** - Don't crowd the slides
6. **Accessibility** - High contrast, readable fonts

**Animations (Optional):**
- Slide 2: Animate workflow arrows (1→2→3→4) to appear sequentially
- Slide 3: Animate the barrier/wall between tenants for emphasis

**Notes Section (for presenter):**
- Add brief talking points under each slide
- Include statistics: "10,000+ tables", "200+ data engineers", "Zero production impact"

## Additional Instructions for Copilot:

- Use only **built-in PowerPoint shapes** (rectangles, circles, arrows, icons from Insert > Icons)
- **No code snippets or terminal commands**
- **No detailed technical jargon** - this is for business stakeholders
- Focus on **visual storytelling**
- Ensure all text is **large enough to read from 10 feet away**
- Use **SmartArt** where appropriate for processes/hierarchies
- Add a **simple footer** with: "Confidential - Internal Use Only | Modern Data Catalog PoC"

## How to Use This Prompt:

1. **Copy everything between "PROMPT START" and "PROMPT END"**
2. **Paste into Microsoft Copilot** in PowerPoint:
   - Open PowerPoint
   - Click the Copilot button
   - Select "Create presentation from prompt"
   - Paste the prompt
3. **Review and refine** the generated slides
4. **Customize** with your bank's branding (logo, colors)

## Alternative: If Using ChatGPT/Claude for Slide Content

Ask the AI to generate:
1. **Detailed slide layout descriptions** (you build manually in PPT)
2. **Speaker notes** for each slide
3. **Suggested icons** from Microsoft's icon library

Then use PowerPoint's Designer feature to apply professional layouts.

---

## Tips for Maximum Impact:

1. **Rehearse the presentation** - 2-3 slides should take 5-7 minutes
2. **Focus on business outcomes**, not technical features
3. **Use the architecture diagram** (Slide 2) as your anchor - refer back to it
4. **Emphasize tenant isolation** - this resonates with banking security teams
5. **Be ready to answer**: "What's the migration timeline?" and "What if Gravitino fails?"

---

## Expected Output:

A **2-3 slide PowerPoint** that:
- ✅ Looks professionally designed (not DIY)
- ✅ Uses visual hierarchy and iconography
- ✅ Explains complex architecture simply
- ✅ Emphasizes business value over technical complexity
- ✅ Can be presented in 5-7 minutes
- ✅ Leaves stakeholders confident in the approach
