Create a 3-slide PowerPoint for banking executives about our modern data catalog architecture. Highly visual, minimal text, focused on business value.

**Design:** Navy blue (#1B365D), teal (#00A896), orange accents (#FF6B35). Use icons over text. Minimum 14pt fonts. Professional, clean, plenty of white space.

  1. Broken chain icon: "Single Point of Failure - HMS outages impact 200+ engineers"
  2. No entry icon: "No Audit Trail - 8hr recovery from unauthorized table drop"
  3. Old computer icon: "Legacy Infrastructure - Physical servers, not containerized"

**RIGHT - Our Solution:**
- Title: "Modern Catalog: Secure, Scalable, Containerized"
- Shield/checkmark icon at top
- 3 stacked rounded rectangles:
  1. Connected nodes icon: "Multi-Catalog Architecture - No single point of failure"
  2. Document checkmarks icon: "Complete Audit Trail - Compliance-ready"
  3. Container icon: "Cloud-Native - Docker/Kubernetes ready"

### Slide 2: "Architecture - How It Works"

**Title:** "Unified Catalog Architecture"

**Layered diagram using PowerPoint shapes:**

**TOP LAYER - Governance (light gray):**
- Wide rounded rectangle
- Label: "Audit & Compliance Layer"
- 3 document icons: "Catalog Logs" | "Query Logs" | "Storage Logs"

**MIDDLE LAYER - Catalog (navy blue, white text):**
- Wide rounded rectangle
- Label: "Gravitino - Unified Catalog Management"
- 3 connected boxes with arrows:
  - Database cylinder icon: "Polaris (Production Iceberg)"
  - Git branch icon: "Nessie (Migration Staging)"
  - Filing cabinet icon: "HMS (Legacy - Phasing Out)"

**BOTTOM LAYER - Split into two:**

Left box (teal) - "Compute":
- Lightning icon: "Apache Spark"
- Notebook icon: "Jupyter"

Right box (green) - "Storage":
- 2 bucket icons side-by-side:
  - "Tenant A Bucket" (store icon)
  - "Tenant B Bucket" (office icon)
- Below: "NetApp StorageGRID (S3)"

**Numbered workflow arrows (1-4):**
1. Compute → Gravitino: "Request metadata"
2. Gravitino → Polaris: "Route to catalog"
3. Polaris → Storage: "Return location"
4. Compute → Storage: "Access data"

Use drop shadows, rounded corners, color-code each layer.

### Slide 3: "Business Value & Security"

**Two-column layout:**

**LEFT (40%) - Business Value:**
- Title: "What This Means for the Bank"
- 4 benefit cards (rounded rectangles):
  1. Shield icon: "Risk Mitigation" - "Zero-downtime migration"
  2. Clock-arrow icon: "Time Travel" - "Regulatory point-in-time queries"
  3. Lock icon: "Tenant Isolation" - "Retail & Investment units segregated"
  4. Cloud icon: "Modern Infrastructure" - "Containerized, K8s-ready"

**RIGHT (60%) - Tenant Isolation Visual:**
- Title: "Multi-Tenant Security Model"

**Top section:**
- Rounded rectangle: "Shared Gravitino Platform"
- Inside, 2 boxes with RED BARRIER between them:
  - Left (store icon): "Retail Banking" - mini icons for customers, transactions, risk tables
  - Right (office icon): "Investment Banking" - mini icons for portfolios, trades, market tables
- Text: "Access Control Enforced"

**Bottom section:**
- 2 separate storage buckets with padlock icons:
  - "tenant-a-bucket" (store icon)
  - "tenant-b-bucket" (office icon)
- Arrows from namespaces to buckets
- Text: "Storage-Level Isolation via S3 Policies"

Use green for allowed, red for denied access.

**Footer:** "Confidential - Internal Use Only | Modern Data Catalog PoC"

**Animations (optional):** Slide 2 workflow arrows appear sequentially. Slide 3 barrier animates for emphasis.

**Speaker notes:** Include stats - "10,000+ tables", "200+ engineers", "Zero production impact"

Use only built-in PowerPoint shapes and icons. No code, no jargon. Visual storytelling for executives.

## PROMPT END

---

## How to Use This Prompt:

1. **Copy everything between "PROMPT START" and "PROMPT END"**
2. **Paste into Microsoft Copilot** in PowerPoint:
   - Open PowerPoint
   - Click the Copilot button
   - Select "Create presentation from prompt"
   - Paste the prompt
3. **Review and refine** the generated slides
4. **Customize** with your bank's branding (logo, colors)

## Alternative: If Using ChatGPT/Claude for Slide Content

Ask the AI to generate:
1. **Detailed slide layout descriptions** (you build manually in PPT)
2. **Speaker notes** for each slide
3. **Suggested icons** from Microsoft's icon library

Then use PowerPoint's Designer feature to apply professional layouts.

## Tips for Maximum Impact:

1. **Rehearse the presentation** - 2-3 slides should take 5-7 minutes
2. **Focus on business outcomes**, not technical features
3. **Use the architecture diagram** (Slide 2) as your anchor - refer back to it
4. **Emphasize tenant isolation** - this resonates with banking security teams
5. **Be ready to answer**: "What's the migration timeline?" and "What if Gravitino fails?"

## Expected Output:

A **2-3 slide PowerPoint** that:
- ✅ Looks professionally designed (not DIY)
- ✅ Uses visual hierarchy and iconography
- ✅ Explains complex architecture simply
- ✅ Emphasizes business value over technical complexity
- ✅ Can be presented in 5-7 minutes
- ✅ Leaves stakeholders confident in the approach
